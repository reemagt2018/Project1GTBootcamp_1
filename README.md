## Project Description / Outline:
#### Our project will focus on criteria to review for house-hunting.  A person decides they want to relocate and has certain criteria they use to find their next home.  We are creating an application that allows anyone to input a desired city and return data for that location
```
1. Location
2. Average Home Value
3. Crime Rate
4. Transit Options
5. School
```
***
## Research Questions to Answer:
```
1. What correlations do we observe?
 a. Is there a correlation between price and school?
 b. Is there a correlation between price and transit options?
 c. Is there a correlation between price and neighborhood?
2. Compare zip code in each city
 a. Based on criteria, which location is better?
